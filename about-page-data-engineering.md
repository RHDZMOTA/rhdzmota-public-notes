## About this course

This course aims to provide the students with a thinking 
framework that allows students to (a) formulate the right 
problems and (b) implement innovative solutions in the Data 
Engineering field.

To achieve this goal, students must get familiarized with the 
latest technological advancements in the data science and 
engineering fields and develop a technical skill set that 
comprises of distributed processing, data architectures, data 
pipelines, and machine learning.


The course is divided into 2 sections:

1. **Data Engineering principles and fundamentals**
    * This first section introduces the relevent concepts in the data-engineering field. We'll be focusing on contextualizing the data-engineering field and understanding the fundamental ideas behind model data engineering.

2. **Data Engineering in practice**
    * During this section, we'll review design data architectures and develop data processing pipelines using industry-grade technology stacks.
