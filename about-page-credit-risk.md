## About this course

This course aims to provide the students with a thinking framework that allows them to **(a)** formulate the right problems and **(b)** implement innovative solutions in the context of Credit Risk Modeling. To achieve this goal, students must get familiarized with the latest technological advancements in the fintech industry and develop a technical skillset that comprises of data engineering, statistical modeling, financial acumen, and machine learning. 

The course is divided into three sections:

1. **Technological fundamentals** of financial applications
    * _This is the "tech" on "fintech"._
    * The first section introduces the common fintech industry practices to develop and maintain simple financial applications. We'll go through a set of exercises and examples to improve your technical proficiency and take your coding and algorithmic skills to the next level. 

2. **Financial theory** and concepts behind credit risk
    * _This is the "fin" on "fintech"._
    * During this section, we'll review the basic financial concepts and contextualize the credit risk problem in financial terms.

3. **Machine Learning** for Credit risk modeling
    * This is the essence/core of "fintech". 
    * In the final module, we'll introduce the most common machine learning modeling techniques to solve the credit-risk problem formulation.
