## Courses & Lectures - Privacy Policy

This privacy policy explains how the student data is collected and managed 
in extension to the particular privacy concerns of the parent university or learning site.

Topics: 

* What data is collected? 
* How do we collect your data? 
* How is your data used? 
* How do we store your data? 
* Deleting your data
* Contact information

### What data is collected? 

We only collect information relevant to the course's educational purposes.
This might include, but is not limited to, non-sensitive personal information, socio-demographic data, course notes, and credit scores from different providers.

In addition, some lecture/course might also be recorded. These recordings will be made available exclusively to the 
corresponding students for future reference and personal use. The professor reserves the right to delete these videos
anytime without previous notice.

### How do we collect your data? 

Data is mostly collected via online surveys.

### How is your data used? 

The data we collect is used for **academic and educational purposes**. We might distribute an anonymize version of the data to the students as part of an exercise/homework/project/exam. The data-anonymization process deletes all [personally identifiable information (PII)] markers from the data. 

### How do we store your data? 

The data is directly managed by the professor and might be stored in different formats. Main two scenarios: 

* Data stored in a cloud provider (e.g., Google Services).
* Data stored in a local filesystem (e.g., as plain files on your professor's computer)

Regardless of the particular scenario, all the sensitive [personally identifiable information (PII)]
will be [encrypted](https://searchsecurity.techtarget.com/definition/encryption)
and the data-holder (professor) will follow the [recommended security guidelines](https://www.ngdata.com/data-privacy-guide-for-banks-and-financial-institutions/).
Consider that this encryption process will be done after the semester finalizes if the data is not deleted.
Some records might remain unencrypted, if they are considered as relevant student "learning evidence" by the university.

### Deleting your data

When requested, your [personally identifiable information (PII)] can be deleted at any time. 

### Contact information

For any questions, request, or concerns, please contact your professor via Slack or send and email to [contact@rhdzmota.com](https://rhdzmota.com/).
