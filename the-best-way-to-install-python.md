Letâ€™s be honest about this. Python is great, but managing multiple python versions & dependencies across different projects is not. As a professional data engineer and university professor, I would like a reliable python installation method that allows me to keep each project's dependencies isolated and does not introduce extra complexity to the management process. There are two candidates:
* **(Close enough) Dockerizing everything!** This approach works great on an engineering environment but introduces extra complexity on an academic context.
* **(Winner) Using [pyenv][pyenv] and [venv][venv]**. Keeps everything "python friendly" without introducing foreign ideas.

You should probably know about [Python Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) as a complementary tool (read more [here](https://muttdata.ai/blog/2020/08/21/a-poetic-apology.html)). Poetry is great if you are actively developing python tooling and packages. I will update this post with installation/usage instructions, ~eventually. Until then, let's keep it simple.

## Prerequisites

**For MacOS/Unix users**, a regular terminal with `git` installed should work fine.

**For Windowns users**, one of the following is recommended:
* [Git Bash](https://git-scm.com/downloads) - recommended for entry-level users.
* [WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install)

Both users should have `git` installed and [configured][git-config] on their preferred terminal.

## PyEnv Installation: 3 Easy Steps

### **STEP 1**: Install PyEnv

Open a terminal and execute the following command:

```commandline
$ curl -L https://rhdzmota.com/code/pyenv.sh | bash -s -- install
```
* That command will install `pyenv` in the root directory.

### **STEP 2**: Configure in your terminal

Add `pyenv` to the path, configured via your terminal. Execute the following command to detect which shell you are using:

```commandline
$ echo $SHELL
```

* If you are using `Git Bash` or `/usr/bin/bash`, run the following:
    * Execute: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.bashrc`
    * Reload: `source ~/.bashrc`


* If you are using `/usr/bin/zsh`, run the following:
    * Execute: `echo 'export PATH="$HOME/.pyenv/bin:$PATH"' >> ~/.zshrc`
    * Reload: `source ~/.zshrc`

### **STEP 3**: Verify installation

Test your installation by running:

```commandline
$ pyenv help
```

Should output something similar to:

```text
Usage: pyenv <command> [<args>]

Some useful pyenv commands are:
   commands    List all available pyenv commands
   local       Set or show the local application-specific Python version
   global      Set or show the global Python version
   shell       Set or show the shell-specific Python version
   install     Install a Python version using python-build
   uninstall   Uninstall a specific Python version
   rehash      Rehash pyenv shims (run this after installing executables
   version     Show the current Python version and its origin
   versions    List all Python versions available to pyenv
   which       Display the full path to an executable
   whence      List all Python versions that contain the given executable

See `pyenv help <command>' for information on a specific command.
For full documentation, see: https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#readme

```

## Python Versions & Installation

The beauty of pyenv is that it allows us to easily install multiple python versions. As a recommendation, I usually install the latest [databricks long-term support runtime (LTS)][DBR_LTS] recommended python version. At the time, this is the `3.8.8` version.

[DBR_LTS]: https://docs.databricks.com/release-notes/runtime/releases.html

### Install multiple python versions

Let's install the recomended python versions for the following databricks runtimes:
* `7.3 LTS Runtime`: `3.7.5 Python`
* `9.1 LTS Runtime`: `3.8.8 Python`


We can easily do this by running the following:
* `pyenv install 3.7.5`
* `pyenv install 3.8.8`

Set the global and local default version to `3.7.5`:
* `pyenv global 3.7.5` - referes to the python version that should be used globally. It's used as a fallback when the local configuration is not set.
* `pyenv local 3.7.5` - referes to the "local" python version that should be used at a "directory" level. You can set each directory to a different local python version.

Show all installed versions with: `pyenv versions`
* The `*` indicates which python version is being referenced in the curent location.

## Running python commands

You can run python through pyenv as  following:

```commandline
$ pyenv exec python <command>
```
* Example 1: `pyenv exec python --version`
* Example 2: `pyenv exec python -c 'print("Hello, world.")'`

**I strongly recommend** using python's venv (virtual environment) module to manage python dependencies. A good practice is to create an independent `venv` on each project to:
* Enable using different python versions per project when needed.
* Isolate dependencies and avoid any possible mismatch or incompatibilities across projects.

Once you are on a project directory, run the following to create a virtualenv:

```commandline
$ pyenv exec python -m venv venv
```
* Expected output: a new directory called `venv` in the root of the project.

You can activate the virutal environemnt with the following commands:
* MacOS/Unix users: `source venv/bin/activate`
* Windows users: `source venv/Scripts/activate`

Once you activate the `venv`, you should be able to use `python` directly in the terminal:

```commandline
$ python --version
```

Congratulations! You are now ready to go.

{{% callout warning %}}
When working with git, do not add/commit the `venv` folder into the repository. You can make git to ignore this directory by creating a `.gitignore` file with a single line containing: `venv`.

## Usage - Cheat Sheet

* Set the local python version (relative to current directory)

```commandline
$ pyenv local X.Y.Z
```

* Create a python virtual environment via pyenv

```commandline
$ pyenv exec python -m venv venv
```

* Activate/Deactivate virtualenv:
    * Activate:
        * Windows users: `source venv/Scripts/activate`
        * Everyone else: `source venv/bin/activate`
    * Deactivate: `deactivate`


* Install requirements file:

```commandline
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
